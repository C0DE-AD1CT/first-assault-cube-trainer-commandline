COMPLETED ON : 01/01/2021
created using visual studio 2022 Free edition 

offsets and pointers where achieved using cheat engine
the cheat-table is linked in the folder: cheat-table

This was a passion project, to see if I could write a program to access the pointers of another program and change their value. 
To do this I used a open source game Assault cube and I used cheat engine to obtain the addresses. 
I also used visual studio code 2022 community edition to write the code.
